Configuration
=============

The configuration of the @PLUGIN@ plugin is done in the `gerrit.config`
file. `auth.type` must be set to `OAUTH`:

```
[auth]
  type = OAUTH
```

Google and GitHub specific providers are configured under @PLUGIN@ section,
appended with provider suffix: `-google-oauth` and `-github-oauth`:

```
  [plugin "@PLUGIN@-google-oauth"]
    client-id = "<client-id>"
    client-secret = "<client-secret>"
    callback = "http://localhost:8080/oauth"

  [plugin "@PLUGIN@-github-oauth"]
    client-id = "<client-id>"
    client-secret = "<client-secret>"
    callback = "http://localhost:8080/oauth"
```

When one from the sections above is omitted, OAuth SSO is used. The login form with provider selection isnâ€™t shown. When both sections are omitted, Gerrit will not start.
